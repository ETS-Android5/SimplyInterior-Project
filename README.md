# SimplyInterior Android App üì±
This repository contains the Application that my team has developed in Appathon conducted by ADG VIT.

# Introduction ‚ú®
Have you ever faced problems while furniture shopping online? What about the inconvenience of liking a product online just to find out they won't fit or are too small? We present to you SimplyInterior, your one-stop solution to solve all your problems and hassles related to online furniture shopping!

# About The Project üìù
Using SimplyInterior users would be able to measure real-world objects or even space by simply pointing their phone‚Äôs camera at the given item using Augmented Reality(AR) technology. The measurements which are taken using AR will be used to display the relevant options of furniture which can be purchased from various E-commerce websites. Our application can also be used to get readings in metric units to bring back up when you‚Äôre at IKEA later on.
